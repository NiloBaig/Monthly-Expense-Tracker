# Monthly-Expense-Tracker
MonthlyExpenseTracker is a Python application used to track all the expenses throughout the month.
Here a user can add his monthly income and keep a track of all the expenses occurred in the current month.
The expenses can be added in one-go using a csv file, or can be added anytime randomly.
It also shows a graphical view of the expenses throughout the month or for a given date range in a month.

## Input
User can upload a csv file with all the expenditures throughout the month, or can add it via running the program.
A sample expenses file is attached for reference.

## Clean Code Development
### 1. Consistent Naming Convention
snake_case convention has been followed throughout the code, for both variables as well as functions. All names are easy to remember, descriptive, searchable and clear.

### 2. Comments
Although the code is quite self-explanatory, few comments have been added to help someone understand in the plainest way possible.

### 3. Exception handling
Try and except blocks have been added in every function to easily determine the cause and location of the error, and to make code look good.

### 4. Clean use of functions
Functions are kept short, with less arguments.

### 5. Context Manager
To interact with the external data file, with statement is used. It helps in deallocating memory automatically outside of the block.
